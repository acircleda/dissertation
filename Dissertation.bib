  abstract = {Would somebody be more willing to start recycling if they knew that their friends were all recycling? Social influence refers to the ways in which our behaviour is affected by what other people do, or by what other people think. Various insights from theories of social influence have been applied as part of interventions to encourage resource conservation, such as the use of social norms, social learning, and social comparison processes. The question arises: Is social influence as effective as is sometimes assumed? This review compares the effectiveness of different social influence approaches to encourage resource conservation via a meta-analysis and outlines what remains to be learned about the mechanisms linking social influence to behaviour change. A random-effects meta-analysis with a sample of 29 studies revealed that social influence approaches were effective when compared to a control group. They were also more effective when compared to another intervention, although in this case the effect size was small. The effectiveness was different for different social influence approaches and for different target groups. These findings raise a number of important questions, which form the basis of a research agenda for better understanding the processes through which social influence approaches encourage resource conservation.},

Human capital, which is based on education and rate of return on education, may reduce the ecological footprint since environmental issues are human-induced. The current study investigates the impact of human capital on the ecological footprint in India for the period 1971 to 2014. The outcomes of the newly developed combined cointegration test of Bayer and Hanck disclose the long-run equilibrium relationship between variables. The findings reveal a significant negative contribution of human capital to the ecological footprint. The results of the causality test show that human capital Granger causes the ecological footprint without any feedback. In addition, energy consumption adds to the ecological footprint, while the relationship between economic growth and ecological footprint follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. The findings unveil the potential to reduce the ecological footprint by developing human capital.},

In this paper, we focus on how this information should be incorporated into the estimation of efficiency measures of student or school performance using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Thus far, previous studies that have adopted this approach using data from ILSAs have used only one of the available plausible values or an average of all of them. We propose an approach based on the fuzzy DEA, which allows us to consider the whole distribution of results as a proxy of student abilities. To assess the extent to which our proposal offers similar results to those obtained in previous studies, we provide an empirical example using PISA data from 2015. Our results suggest that the performance measures estimated using the fuzzy DEA approach are strongly correlated with measures calculated using just one plausible value or an average measure. Therefore, we conclude that the studies that decide upon using one of these options do not seem to be making a significant error in their estimates.},

Here, we examine how support for several possible decarbonization policies varies as a function of the personal carbon footprint of a researcher who advocates the policy. We find that people are more likely to support policies if the advocate for these policies has a low carbon footprint. Replicating our prior work, we find that the communicators' carbon footprint massively affect their credibility and intentions of their audience to conserve energy (Attari, Krantz and Weber 2016). Our new finding is that their carbon footprint also affects audience support for public policies advocated by the communicator. In a second study, we show that the negative effects of a large carbon footprint on credibility are greatly reduced if the communicator reforms their behavior by reducing their personal carbon footprints. The implications of these results are stark: effective communication of climate science and advocacy of both individual behavior change and public policy interventions are greatly helped when advocates lead the way by reducing their own carbon footprint.},

  abstract = {Educators seeking to address global warming in their classrooms face numerous challenges, including the question of whether student opinions about anthropogenic global warming (AGW) can change in response to increased knowledge about the climate system. This article analyzes survey responses from 458 students at a primarily undergraduate institution in the U.S.’s intermountain West, finding increased levels of concern with increased levels of climate literacy, including among students whose political affiliation might indicate skepticism about AGW. However, overall levels of climate literacy were found to be quite low for many students, allowing other factors, notably political affiliation, to become dominant predictors of AGW concern.},

  abstract = {Cross-national research on cultural differences across space and time intersects multiple disciplines but the prominence of concepts varies by academic fields. Hofstede’s dimensional concept of culture, to begin with, dominates in cross-cultural psychology and international management. Inglehart’s dynamic concept of culture, by contrast, prevails in sociology and political science. We argue that this disciplinary division is unfortunate because the two concepts are complementary, for which reason a synthesis rectifies their mutual weaknesses. Indeed, while Hofstede’s dimensional concept neglects cultural dynamics, Inglehart’s dynamic concept is dimensionally reductionist. We demonstrate empirically that combining these two concepts leads to an improved understanding of cultural differences. Inspired by Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, we use data from the European Value Studies and World Values Surveys for 495,011 individuals born between 1900 and 1999 in 110 countries and then show that change on these dimensions proceeds as Inglehart and his collaborators suggest. Most notably, younger generations have become more individualistic and more joyous. But even though economic development and generational replacement drive this cultural change, roughly half of the variation in national cultural orientations is unique to each country, due to lasting intercept differences in developmental trajectories that trace back to remote historic drivers. We discuss the implications for cross-national cultural research.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the reliability and validity of Hofstede's cultural framework when applied at the individual consumer level. Design/methodology/approach – MBA students and faculty in the behavioral sciences were asked to review Hofstede's cultural instrument and to indicate which dimension (power distance, individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity/femininity) each particular item was intended to reflect. Subjects were also asked to respond to each item, thus indicating their underlying values. The reliability of each dimension was computed, and the data were factor analyzed to determine whether the various items loaded in a manner that is consistent with Hofstede's framework, thus providing evidence as to discriminant and convergent validity. Findings – This study presents evidence that Hofstede's cultural instrument lacks sufficient construct validity when applied at an individual level of analysis. Overall, a majority of the items were lacking in face validity, the reliabilities of the four dimensions were low, and the factor analyses did not result in a coherent structure. Research limitations/implications – It is hoped that these findings will eventually lead to a reliable and valid measure that captures the richness of the various cultural dimensions and can be deployed at the individual and sub‐group levels of analysis. Such a measure would be valuable for market segmentation, and for understanding why consumers from diverse regions and cultures react differently to various marketing tactics. Originality/value – Given the diversity of the world marketplace, it is essential that marketers have a robust measure of culture so that our understanding of consumer behavior can keep pace with a rapidly changing environment.},

This paper reviews the measures" setup, strength, and weaknesses across the three most prominent democracy datasets: PolityIV, Freedom House, and Varieties of Democracy. The measures developed by the Varieties of Democracy project outperform Polity2 and Freedom House Index with respect to the underlying definition and measurement scale, as well as the theoretical justification of the aggregation procedure. The three indices display a high level of agreement for those observations included in all three datasets. The most substantial differences between the indices lie in the indices’ coverage, i.e. in their non-missing observations (in Polity2 coding, for example, years during which a country is occupied by foreign powers constitute missing values), the availability of disaggregate data and the above mentioned key areas. This paper clarifies when to proceed with caution, but for the most part advocates the use of Varieties of Democracy in the statistical analysis of democracy.},

  abstract = {The environmental attitudes of young people are a growing topic of interest for social scientists. Most research that aims to explain differences in (youth) environmental attitudes focuses on the individual as the level of measurement. There is, however, a growing body of evidence that illustrates that the context within which that individual operates can contribute to their environmental attitudes. Based on the PISA 2006 data, and while controlling for individual characteristics, we tested Inglehart's `objective problems, subjective values' hypothesis. This hypothesis divides the contextual influences on environmental attitudes into (1) objective problems in the individual's natural environment and (2) subjective values linked to post-materialistic goals in life. We analyzed both the individual and the country level simultaneously, controlling for compositional effects, by performing a multilevel analysis on the 2006 PISA data for youth environmental attitudes (398,750 15 year olds from 56 countries). At the individual level, the results are generally consistent with the literature; at the contextual level, the stage of development of a country (as a proxy for postmaterialistic values) is shown to be unrelated to environmental attitudes. Both natural riches of a country and its environmental problems are shown to positively influence the environmental attitudes of that country's youth. These results are discussed in relation to the `objective problems, subjective values' hypothesis. The results also point towards the necessity of simultaneously assessing the effect of individual- and contextual-level characteristics on environmental attitudes.},

The carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) is a sustainability indicator that captures environmental impact and social well-being in a single measure. One of the benefits of this measure is that it can be applied across different scales and contexts to explore factors that might reduce the CIWB, leading to greater sustainability. We demonstrate the further utility of the indicator by analyzing CIWB in the United States at the state-level and take an intersectional approach, calculating CIWB by race and gender. We find income inequality contributes to larger CIWB for all groups, but the impacts are greater for blacks compared to whites and males compared to females. Economic growth is also associated with larger CIWB for all groups. These results suggest that to achieve more sustainable outcomes may require policies that address inequalities as well as broader changes to economies.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2~°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5~°C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers.},

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces intsvy, an R package for working with international assessment data (e.g., PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS). The package includes functions for importing data, performing data analysis, and visualizing results. The paper describes the underlying methodology and provides real data examples. Tools for importing data allow useRs to select variables from student, home, school, and teacher survey instruments as well as for specific countries. Data analysis functions take into account the complex sample design (with replicate weights) and rotated test forms (with plausible values of achievement scores) in the calculation of point estimates and standard errors of means, standard deviations, regression coefficients, correlation coefficients, and frequency tables. Visualization tools present data aggregates in standardized graphical form.},

  abstract = {Scale development involves numerous theoretical, methodological, and statistical competencies. Despite the central role that scales play in our predictions, scholars often apply measurement building procedures that are inconsistent with best practices. The defaults in statistical programs, inadequate training, and numerous evaluation points can lead to improper practices. Based on a quantitative content analysis of communication journal articles, scholars have improved very little in the communication of their scale development decisions and practices. To address these reoccurring issues, this article breaks down and recommends 10 steps to follow in the scale development process for researchers unfamiliar with the process. Furthermore, the present research makes a unique contribution by overviewing procedures scholars should employ to develop their dimensions and corresponding items. The overarching objective is to encourage the adoption of scale development best practices that yield stronger concepts, and in the long run, a more stable foundation of knowledge.},

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) is widely used in assessment and evaluation research to explain how participants respond to item level stimuli. Several R packages can be used to estimate the parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been implemented in any R package. The mirt package was created for estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional EM estimation (e.g., Bock and Aitkin 1981) is presented for exploratory item response models as well as for confirmatory bifactor models (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm described by Cai (2010a,b). Various program comparisons are presented and future directions for the package are discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite the global scale of climate change, research comparing people’s behavioural expression of their concern for the problem across societies is lacking. The present investigation adopts a person-context interaction approach to provide such a comparison and demonstrates the influences of societal-level factors. We propose that some sociocultural contexts tend to be more agentic, allowing people to express their internal attributes, including climate change concern, whereas some contexts tend to be more restrictive, hindering people from doing so. With two international datasets, we observed that the association between climate change concern and mitigation behaviour was stronger among societies with higher levels of self-expression affordance (indicated by lower levels of disease threat and higher levels of governance quality, economic development, and individualism). These results indicate the importance of considering not only individual-level determinants but also societal-level factors in the study of people’s behavioural response to climate change. They also offer insights into how environmental practitioners and decision makers can promote mitigation behaviour.},

In this paper, we investigate the long-term impact that an intensive one-year university course had on individual carbon emissions by surveying students at least five years after having taken the course. A majority of course graduates reported pro-environmental decisions (i.e., type of car to buy, food choices) that they attributed at least in part to experiences gained in the course. Furthermore, our carbon footprint analysis suggests that for the average course graduate, these decisions reduced their individual carbon emissions by 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. Surveys and focus group interviews identify that course graduates have developed a strong personal connection to climate change solutions, and this is realized in their daily behaviors and through their professional careers. The paper discusses in more detail the specific components of the course that are believed to be most impactful, and the uncertainties associated with this type of research design. Our analysis also demonstrates that if similar education programs were applied at scale, the potential reductions in carbon emissions would be of similar magnitude to other large-scale mitigation strategies, such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal data analysis has long played a significant role in empirical research within the developmental sciences. The past decade has given rise to a host of new and exciting analytic methods for studying between-person differences in within-person change. These methods are broadly organized under the term growth curve models. The historical lines of development leading to current growth models span multiple disciplines within both the social and statistical sciences, and this in turn makes it challenging for developmental researchers to gain a broader understanding of the current state of this literature. To help address this challenge, the authors pose 12 questions that frequently arise in growth curve modeling, particularly in applications within developmental psychology. They provide concise and nontechnical responses to each question and make specific recommendations for further readings.},

  abstract = {Values are often invoked in discussions of how to develop a more sustainable relationship with the environment. There is a substantial literature on values that spans several disciplines. In philosophy, values are relatively stable principles that help us make decisions when our preferences are in conflict and thus convey some sense of what we consider good. In economics, the term values is usually used in discussions of social choice, where an assessment of the social value of various alternatives serves as a guide to the best choice under a utilitarian ethic (the greatest good for the greatest number). In sociology, social psychology, and political science, two major lines of research have addressed environmental values. One has focused on four value clusters: self-interest, altruism, traditionalism, and openness to change and found relatively consistent theoretical and empirical support for the relationship of values to environmentalism. The other line of research suggests that environmentalism emerges when basic material needs are met and that individuals and societies that are postmaterialist in their values are more likely to exhibit pro-environmental behaviors. The evidence in support of this argument is more equivocal. Overall, the idea that values, especially altruism, are related to environmentalism, seems well established, but little can be said about the causes of value change and of the overall effects of value change on changes in behavior.}

Of the eight policies proposed to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, respondents overwhelmingly indicated they would not support a gas tax, while support was highest for shifting subsidies away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy strategies. With the exception of taxes on gasoline and “gas guzzlers,” a majority of respondents supported all other mitigation policies. Multivariate analyses revealed that greater trust in environmentalists and less trust in industry, greater recognition of the consequences of climate change, higher income, being black, and older age were predictive of greater policy support. Personal values (e.g., altruism), future orientation, and political affiliation were strong predictors of policy support but only indirectly via worldviews and environmental beliefs.},

This article will inform the reader of the meaning and interpretation of these two statistical concepts. Methods The uses of these two statistical concepts and the differences between them are discussed on the basis of a selective literature search concerning the methods employed in scientific articles. Results/Conclusions P-values in scientific studies are used to determine whether a null hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability, as well as about the direction and strength of the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they provide complementary types of information.},

  abstract = {The pressing nature of climate change and its associated impacts requires a climate literate citizenry. Climate change education in K-12 settings may provide a unique opportunity to make inroads towards climate literacy. However, many K-12 teachers avoid teaching climate change because they are uncomfortable with the subject or do not see its relevance to their curriculum. Removing barriers to climate change professional development (CCPD) for teachers may help increase confidence in teaching about climate change. To understand the perceived barriers to participating in CCPD, a survey was conducted with 54 middle school science teachers who did not respond to a previous invitation to participate in a CCPD program. The most significant barrier was time to participate. The participants were also asked to rate their confidence about whether climate change is happening. The results were compared between teachers who were confident climate change was happening and those who were not to examine whether these beliefs influenced teachers' perceptions of barriers. Those who were confident climate change was happening were less likely to perceive administrative support, interest in the workshop, and knowledge of climate change content as barriers. However, both groups of teachers reported that time was the primary barrier rather than the topic. This suggests that, rather than developing unique strategies, existing best practices in teacher professional development can be used to support CCPD opportunities. Additional recommendations include thinking creatively about how to create time for teachers to attend and making the professional development directly relevant to teacher's local contexts.},

  abstract = {Global climate change is one of the most severe problems facing societies around the world. Very few assessments of the social forces that influence greenhouse gas emissions have examined gender inequality. Empirical research suggests that women are more likely than men to support environmental protection. Various strands of feminist theory suggest that this is due to women's traditional roles as caregivers, subsistence food producers, water and fuelwood collectors, and reproducers of human life. Other theorists argue that women's status and environmental protection are linked because the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are interconnected processes. For these theoretical and empirical reasons, we hypothesize that in societies with greater gender equality there will be relatively lower impacts on the environment, controlling for other factors. We test this hypothesis using quantitative analysis of cross-national data, focusing on the connection between women's political status and CO2 emissions per capita. We find that CO2 emissions per capita are lower in nations where women have higher political status, controlling for GDP per capita, urbanization, industrialization, militarization, world-system position, foreign direct investment, the age dependency ratio, and level of democracy. This finding suggests that efforts to improve gender equality around the world may work synergistically with efforts to curtail global climate change and environmental degradation more generally.},

  abstract = {The carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) (a ratio measuring the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of life expectancy at birth) is an increasingly popular way to measure the ecological efficiency of nations. Although research demonstrates that economic development typically reduces this efficiency, little research has explored the extent to which social equality improves it. This study uses panel data for 70 nations between 1995 and 2013 to assess how various aspects of gender equality affect the ecological efficiency of nations. We estimate a series of Prais-Winsten regression models with panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) to assess how increases in the percentage of women in parliament, expected years of education for women, and the percentage of women in the labor force independently affect CIWB. Our findings indicate that across all nations, increases in the percentage of women in parliament and expected years of schooling reduce CIWB; however, increases in the percentage of women in the labor force increase CIWB. Our results further show that the relationship between different dimensions of gender equality and CIWB differs between more developed and less developed nations. Finally, we find that increases in the number of women in parliament and women's education attenuate the relationship between women's labor force participation and CIWB. We discuss the variation in our results by reviewing relevant eco-gender literatures and feminist economics.},

Human societies are inherently dependent on plants, most obviously as the basis of food supply, ecosystems, atmospheric and climate regulation, and water cycles, as well as for sources of oxygen, medicine, fuel, and fibre. Society, or terrestrial animal life for that matter, could not exist without plants. Based on this recognition, here we lay the foundations for sociological plant studies, a field that studies the dialectical relationship between human societies and plants. We ground this foundation in a realist-materialist perspective that recognises the ontological independence of plants and does not reduce them to human social constructions. We show how considering plants can help us to understand the emergence of civilisations, state formation, and mechanisation of production at the macro-level, and how human–plant interactions shape everyday life at a more micro-level. We present our formulation of sociological plant studies as a starting point for future research.},

  abstract = {Missing data occur in many types of studies and typically complicate the analysis. Multiple imputation, either using joint modeling or the more flexible fully conditional specification approach, are popular and work well in standard settings. In settings involving nonlinear associations or interactions, however, incompatibility of the imputation model with the analysis model is an issue often resulting in bias. Similarly, complex outcomes such as longitudinal or survival outcomes cannot be adequately handled by standard implementations. In this paper, we introduce the R package JointAI, which utilizes the Bayesian framework to perform simultaneous analysis and imputation in regression models with incomplete covariates. Using a fully Bayesian joint modeling approach it overcomes the issue of uncongeniality while retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification multiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and imputation models as a sequence of univariate models that can be adapted to the type of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof as well as survival models and joint models for longitudinal and survival data, that take arguments analogous to the corresponding well known functions for the analysis of complete data from base R and other packages. Usage and features of JointAI are described and illustrated using various examples and the theoretical background is outlined.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (E\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (G\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{OCEAN}) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (S\textsubscript{LAND}) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (B\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \&plusmn;1\&sigma;. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our E\textsubscript{LUC} estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries\&rsquo; climate progress.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}For the year 2020, E\textsubscript{FOS} declined by 5.4\&thinsp;\% relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} (9.3\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), E\textsubscript{LUC} was 0.9\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, for a total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emission of 10.2\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} (37.4\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;2.9\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also, for 2020, G\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.0\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} (2.4\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}), S\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 3.0\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.4\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} and S\textsubscript{LAND} was 2.9\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, with a B\textsubscript{IM} of \&minus;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm. Preliminary data for 2021, suggest a rebound in E\textsubscript{FOS} relative to 2020 of +4.9\&thinsp;\% (4.1\&thinsp;\% to 5.7\&thinsp;\%) globally.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\&ndash;2020, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra- tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Qu\&eacute;r\&eacute; et al., 2018b, 2018a, 2016, 2015b, 2015a, 2014, 2013).

The findings are congruent with the affluence hypothesis and Inglehart's subjective values hypothesis. They also point to the necessity of simultaneously assessing the effects of individual- and contextual-level characteristics on proenvironmental attitudes in cross-national research.},

  abstract = {Cross-cultural comparisons often investigate values that are assumed to have long-lasting influence on human conduct and thought. To capture and compare cultural values across cultures, Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory has offered an influential framework. Hofstede also provided a survey instrument, the Values Survey Module (VSM), for measuring cultural values as outlined in his Cultural Dimensions Theory. The VSM has since been subject to a series of revisions. Yet, data on countries have been derived from the original VSM — and not on one of the revised versions of VSM. We tested three scales (indulgence, power distance, and individualism) from the latest version, the VSM 2013, as part of a larger survey across 57 countries. Two main findings emerged. For one thing, country scores based on the VSM 2013 scales correlated only weakly with country scores of the same cultural dimensions obtained in a large previous study. Thus, the validity of the VSM 2013 is in doubt. For another thing, the internal consistency of the VSM 2013 scales was overall poor, indicating that the scales did not reliably measure well-defined constructs. We discuss implications for cross-cultural research.},

  abstract = {We contribute to literature exploring the socioecological impact of urban development as a multidimensional project, one in which changes to landscape features complement changes in demographic and administrative measures to co-constitute the socioecological impact of urbanity. We use a random coefficients modeling approach to examine U.S. relationships between the intensity of impervious surface within a county, population density in impervious areas, and carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB)?here constructed using industrial emissions.

In a survey involving 601 Danish families, we examine to which extent adolescents' everyday pro-environmental behaviour is the outcome of their own pro-environmental attitudes or the product of social influence within the family, that is, a reflection of the dominating values and norms in the family group as manifested most clearly in their parents' attitudes and behaviour. In addition, we examine the moderating effects of two family characteristics, parenting style and the “generation gap” (parent–child age difference), on the relative weight of adolescents' personal attitudes vs. social influences within the family as predictors of adolescents' pro-environmental behaviour. Results show that the adolescents' pro-environmental behaviour is heavily influenced by the dominating norms within the family and in particular by how strongly they are manifested in their parents' behaviour.},

  abstract = {We present a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set, HadCRUT5. HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near-surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961–1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea-surface temperature (SST) measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near-surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in SST measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200-member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input data sets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in SST measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature data sets, despite their different approaches to data set construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen.},

We examine the relationship between economic growth and \$\$\textbackslash mathrm\{CO\}\_2\$\$emissions by considering the role of income inequality in carbon emissions function. To do so, we use a new source of data on top income inequality measured by the share of pretax income earned by the richest 10\% of the population in OECD countries. We also use Gini coefficients, as the two measures capture different features of income distribution. Using recently innovated panel data estimation techniques, we find that an increase in top income inequality is positively associated with \$\$\textbackslash mathrm\{CO\}\_2\$\$emissions. Further, our findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between economic growth and \$\$\textbackslash mathrm\{CO\}\_2\$\$emissions, consistent with environmental Kuznets curve. We find that an increase in the Gini index of inequality is associated with a decrease in carbon emissions, consistent with the marginal propensity to emit approach. Our results are robust to various alternative specifications. Importantly, from a policy perspective, our findings suggest that policies designed to reduce top income inequality can reduce carbon emissions and improve environmental quality.},

This paper explores data from the General Social Survey (GSS), which in 2006 questioned a representative sample of more than 1800 U.S. adults about their knowledge and opinions concerning polar regions. The polar survey items were modeled on long-running GSS assessments of general science knowledge and opinions, recently summarized in the U.S. National Science Board's report Science and Engineering Indicators 2008.

Nominally “scientific” arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n = 541) and Michigan (n = 1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. Narrowcast media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climatechange concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further.

Within an increasingly global context, society expects colleges and universities to undertake new and increasingly complex social responsibilities that expand traditional higher education missions while emphasizing new obligations such as economic development and sustainability. Higher education institutions have responded by adding new programs and services?such as new degree programs, equity and inclusion offices, and training for older workers?and aggressively pursuing new sources of revenue in support of their missions. Despite these considerable efforts, there is a growing sense that higher education is not adequately fulfilling its social responsibilities. We contend that these trends do not stem from intransigence, but are instead symptomatic of the need for strategic management frameworks tailored to the unique social responsibilities and impacts of higher education. To this end, we introduce a strategic social responsibility framework based on the emergent concept of dynamic capabilities. Strategic social responsibility emphasizes the establishment and continuing renewal of an orchestration infrastructure that enables colleges and universities to maximize their social impact through the alignment of strategy and resources.

We argue that multilevel models involving cross-level interactions should always include random slopes on the lower-level components of those interactions. Failure to do so will usually result in severely anti-conservative statistical inference. We illustrate the problem with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and examine its practical relevance by studying 30 prototypical cross-level interactions with European Social Survey data for 28 countries. In these empirical applications, introducing a random slope term reduces the absolute t-ratio of the cross-level interaction term by 31 per cent or more in three quarters of cases, with an average reduction of 42 per cent. Many practitioners seem to be unaware of these issues. Roughly half of the cross-level interaction estimates published in the European Sociological Review between 2011 and 2016 are based on models that omit the crucial random slope term. Detailed analysis of the associated test statistics suggests that many of the estimates would not reach conventional thresholds for statistical significance in correctly specified models that include the random slope.

Using a survey of college-educated adults in the U.S., the study finds strong evidence for selective exposure bias and mixed evidence for resistance to belief change. Importantly, approximately one-third of conservative students who took a college course with climate-change content shifted from initial skepticism or uncertainty to a more confident belief.

The result shows that statistical significance and explanatory power for different independent variables differ greatly, depending on which democracy index is used as the dependent variable. The results also indicate that Freedom House and Polity IV rate many countries’ levels of democracy differently. It is worrying and problematic for comparative studies of democracy that empirical results differ so much according to which measure of democracy is used.},

But, there is no correlation between a local government's adoption of measures promoting government energy conservation and its leader's gender.

  abstract = {This paper presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their energy infrastructures to 100\% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes by 2050. , This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). The plans contemplate 80–85\% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100\% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of ∼39.3\% with ∼82.4\% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with ∼30.9\% onshore wind, ∼19.1\% offshore wind, ∼30.7\% utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), ∼7.2\% rooftop PV, ∼7.3\% concentrated solar power (CSP) with storage, ∼1.25\% geothermal power, ∼0.37\% wave power, ∼0.14\% tidal power, and ∼3.01\% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4\% and 7.2\% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by CSP with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide ∼3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and ∼2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the ∼3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate ∼62\,000 (19\,000–115\,000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and ∼46\,000 (12\,000–104\,000) in 2050, avoiding ∼\$600 (\$85–\$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to ∼3.6 (0.5–14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate ∼\$3.3 (1.9–7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving ∼\$260 (190–320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by ∼\$1500 (210–6000) per year and ∼\$8300 (4700–17\,600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be ∼0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be ∼1.6\% of U.S. land. Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

The roadmaps envision 80\% conversion by 2030 and 100\% by 2050. WWS not only replaces business-as-usual (BAU) power, but also reduces it \$42.5\% because the work: energy ratio of WWS electricity exceeds that of combustion (23.0\%), WWS requires no mining, transporting, or processing of fuels (12.6\%), and WWS end-use efficiency is assumed to exceed that of BAU (6.9\%). Converting may create \$24.3 million more permanent, full-time jobs than jobs lost. It may avoid \$4.6 million/year premature air-pollution deaths today and \$3.5 million/year in 2050; \$\$22.8 trillion/year (12.7 ¢/kWh-BAU-all-energy) in 2050 air-pollution costs; and \$\$28.5 trillion/year (15.8 ¢/kWh-BAU-all-energy) in 2050 climate costs. Transitioning should also stabilize energy prices because fuel costs are zero, reduce power disruption and increase access to energy by decentralizing power, and avoid 1.5 C global warming.},

  abstract = {To achieve the targets of climate change policy, it is important not only to enhance concerns about climate change but also to promote climate-friendly behaviour. Encompassing European Union (EU) countries, the objective of this paper was to analyse how economic development and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions contributed to climate change concerns, personal responsibility, and actions related to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, considering that actions related to climate change mitigation have different costs and benefits, in this study, we aimed to reveal whether climate change concerns and personal responsibility equally influenced all actions related to climate change mitigation and whether all types of actions were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of actions related to climate change mitigation varied across European countries. The largest share of respondents declared that they reduce waste and regularly separate it for recycling. Meanwhile, a smaller share of people noted that they perform very high-cost actions such as the purchase of low-energy homes and electric cars. Economic development level significantly affects the assumption of personal responsibility and the number of actions related to climate change mitigation but not climate change concerns. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions influence climate change concerns, responsibility, and the number of actions differently. Considering separate actions related to climate change mitigation, the assumption of personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced almost all actions. Climate change concerns positively and significantly affected only low-cost actions. Because of the different costs and guiding goals, the respondents who performed one action did not necessarily perform other actions related to climate change mitigation.},

Much of this criticism has focused upon the psychometric scaling model used to create the proficiency scores. The aim of this article is to therefore investigate the robustness of cross-country comparisons of PISA scores to subtle changes to the underlying scaling model used. This includes the specification of the item-response model, whether the difficulty and discrimination of items are allowed to vary across countries (item-by-country interactions) and how test questions not reached by pupils are treated. Our key finding is that these technical choices make little substantive difference to the overall country-level results.},

Drawing from recent empirical studies in environmental sociology and international political-economy, I test the extent to which the impacts of urbanization, domestic income inequality, and literacy rates on per capita ecological footprints vary across zones in the contemporary world-system. This involves the construction of “slope-dummies” and their incorporation into contextual effects analyses that test for heterogeneity of slopes among zones in the world-economy while controlling for additional relevant predictors. Using partial data for 208 countries, I find that the effects of predictor variables do vary among world-system tiers. Domestic income inequality in the core has a positive effect on per capita footprints while the impact of the former in all other zones is negative. The effect of urbanization on per capita footprints is most pronounced in the core, followed by the semiperiphery, high periphery, and low periphery, and the overall effect of literacy rates on ecological footprints is positive while between zone differences are inconclusive.},

This study dissects international power into its various economic, military, and export dependence characteristics, and analyzes their independent effects on per-capita consumption of natural resources, measured as ecological footprints. Findings of the quantitative cross-national analyses indicate that economic power in the form of capital intensity, military technological power, and overall export dependence are the structural driving forces of per-capita resource consumption. The effects of military technological power and export dependence on percapita footprints are primarily direct, whereas the effect of capital intensity is both direct and indirect, partly mediated by its effects on levels of secondary education and domestic income inequality, both of which impact levels of per-capita consumption. The results advance our collective understanding of the complexities of international power, domestic conditions, and uneven environmental outcomes and illustrate the necessity for taking a more nuanced approach to analyses of anthropogenic degradation of the global ecological system.}

  abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between U.S. state-level CO2 emissions and two measures of income inequality: the income share of the top 10\% and the Gini coefficient. Each of the inequality measures, which focus on unique characteristics of income distributions, is used to evaluate the arguments of different analytical approaches. Results of the longitudinal analysis for the 1997 to 2012 period indicate that state-level emissions are positively associated with the income share of the top 10\%, while the effect of the Gini coefficient on emissions is non-significant. The statistically significant relationship between CO2 emissions and the concentration of income among the top 10\% is consistent with analytical approaches that focus on political economy dynamics and Veblen effects, which highlight the potential political and economic power and emulative influence of the wealthy. The null effect of the Gini coefficient is generally inconsistent with the marginal propensity to emit approach, which posits that when incomes become more equally distributed, the poor will increase their consumption of energy and other carbon-intensive products as they move into the middle class.},

Like carbon dioxide emissions, methane emissions are a known contributor to climate change. Results of cross-national fixed effects panel regression analyses indicate that population size, economic development, the production of cereals, cattle, natural gas and oil, and a reliance on food exports all contribute to methane emissions from 1990 to 2005. Most notably, additional findings suggest that the magnitude of the effects of multiple predictors modestly decreased during the period of investigation, while the impact of other predictors remained very stable in magnitude. The authors conclude by considering the substantive implications of the results, the limitations of the study, and outline the next steps in this research agenda.},

Drawing from recent empirical studies in environmental sociology and international political-economy, I test the extent to which the impacts of urbanization, domestic income inequality, and literacy rates on per capita ecological footprints vary across zones in the contemporary world-system. This involves the construction of “slope-dummies” and their incorporation into contextual effects analyses that test for heterogeneity of slopes among zones in the world-economy while controlling for additional relevant predictors. Using partial data for 208 countries, I find that the effects of predictor variables do vary among world-system tiers. Domestic income inequality in the core has a positive effect on per capita footprints while the impact of the former in all other zones is negative. The effect of urbanization on per capita footprints is most pronounced in the core, followed by the semiperiphery, high periphery, and low periphery, and the overall effect of literacy rates on ecological footprints is positive while between zone differences are inconclusive.},

This study dissects international power into its various economic, military, and export dependence characteristics, and analyzes their independent effects on per-capita consumption of natural resources, measured as ecological footprints. Findings of the quantitative cross-national analyses indicate that economic power in the form of capital intensity, military technological power, and overall export dependence are the structural driving forces of per-capita resource consumption. The effects of military technological power and export dependence on percapita footprints are primarily direct, whereas the effect of capital intensity is both direct and indirect, partly mediated by its effects on levels of secondary education and domestic income inequality, both of which impact levels of per-capita consumption. The results advance our collective understanding of the complexities of international power, domestic conditions, and uneven environmental outcomes and illustrate the necessity for taking a more nuanced approach to analyses of anthropogenic degradation of the global ecological system.},

This is because economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90\% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientific literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

  abstract = {Forecasts by economists of the economic damage from climate change have been notably sanguine, compared to warnings by scientists about damage to the biosphere. This is because economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90\% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientific literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

  abstract = {Group-mean centering of independent variables in multi-level models is widely practiced and widely recommended. For example, in cross-national studies of educational performance, family background is scored as a deviation from the country mean for student’s family background. We argue that this is usually a serious mis-specification, introducing bias and random measurement error with all their attendant vices. We examine five diverse examples of ‘‘real world’’ analyses using large, high quality datasets on topics of broad interest in the social sciences. In all of them, consistent with much (but not all) of the technical literature, group-mean centering substantially distorts results. Moreover the distortions are large, substantively important differences pointing towards seriously incorrect interpretations of important social processes. We therefore recommend that group-mean centering be abandoned.},

However, research shows that the relationship among human well-being, resource use, and the associated emissions is complex and context specific. To better understand if natural resource use plays a historic role in generating human well-being in the United States, the authors conduct a time-series analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and average life expectancy from 1913 to 2017. The results show that increases in greenhouse gas emissions per capita have an instantaneous, negative effect on life expectancy. The authors also find evidence that income inequality has a long-run negative effect on life expectancy. Additional analyses provide mixed results regarding whether and how the effects of emissions on life expectancy are conditional on income inequality. These findings contradict the assumption that reductions in emissions necessitate trade-offs in human well-being in high-income contexts.},

  abstract = {When calibrating items using multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models, item response theory (IRT) calibration programs typically set the probability density of latent variables to a multivariate standard normal distribution to handle three types of indeterminacies: (a) the location of the origin, (b) the unit of measurement along each coordinate axis, and (c) the orientation of the coordinate axes. However, by doing so, item parameter estimates obtained from two independent calibration runs on nonequivalent groups are on two different coordinate systems. To handle this issue and place all the item parameter estimates on a common coordinate system, a process called linking is necessary. Although various linking methods have been introduced and studied for the full MIRT model, little research has been conducted on linking methods for the bifactor model. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide detailed descriptions of two separate calibration methods and the concurrent calibration method for the bifactor model and to compare the three linking methods through simulation. In general, the concurrent calibration method provided more accurate linking results than the two separate calibration methods, demonstrating better recovery of the item parameters, item characteristic surfaces, and expected score distribution.},

The lmerTest package extends the 'lmerMod' class of the lme4 package, by overloading the anova and summary functions by providing p values for tests for fixed effects. We have implemented the Satterthwaite's method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I - III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsignificant effects  -  both random and fixed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.},

  abstract = {While the damaging effects of climate change tend to hit the most vulnerable and least skilled people in developing countries—largely girls and women—particularly hard, well-educated girls and women can be a powerful part of the solution to the problem. Girls' education may be one of the most overlooked yet formidable mechanisms for mitigating against weatherrelated catastrophes and adapting to the long-term effects of climate change. For starters, when girls and women are better educated and included in decisionmaking at all levels, their families and communities are more resilient and adaptable to economic and environmental shocks and are better able to plan for, cope with, and rebound from climate crises. Data suggest that there is a strong positive association between the average amount of schooling a girl receives in her country and her country's score on indexes that measure vulnerability to climate-related disasters. Ignoring both the toll of climate change on girls and women as well as the climate-related solutions they can contribute threatens to impede progress on key development goals, including those related to ending poverty, expanding quality education, achieving gender equality, and fostering sustainable cities and agricultural productivity. To bring girls and women to the fore of climate change adaptation and mitigation, we propose that stakeholders in the gender, education, and climate change sectors work together on three platforms: (1) promoting girls' reproductive rights in order to ensure equitable climate action; (2) investing in girls' education in order to foster climate participation and leadership; and (3) spurring actions to develop girls' life skills for a green economy. Making progress on these platforms will require strong support from traditional and non-traditional policy stakeholders, practitioners, and donors.},

In multilevel models, explained variance can be reported for each level or for the total model. Existing measures have been based primarily on the reduction of variance components across models. However, these measures have not been reported consistently because they have some undesirable properties. The present study is one of the first to evaluate the accuracy of these measures using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, a measure based on the full partitioning of variance in multilevel models was examined. With the exception of the Level 2 explained variance measure, all other measures performed well across our simulated conditions.},

Yet, few studies have been able to track the changes and developments of socioeconomic-achievement gaps (SES-achievement gaps henceforward) across time. Using PISA data from 2003 to 2018, we estimated family SES-achievement gaps in seven Asian education systems. The findings suggest that in mainland China the gaps are most pronounced, whereas in Macao, they remain consistently modest. Other systems fall in between these two extremes. Based on the new synchronic and diachronic pieces of evidence, we extrapolate possible explanations of varying SES-achievement gaps across education systems. We found that the gaps tend to be smaller when the low-socioeconomic students perform better in academic environments. Based on our analysis, we argue that if the policy goal is to reduce the learning gap associated with social and economic division, public attention in education should be directed towards students from disadvantaged backgrounds.},

Findings are presented from an interpretive study involving children aged between seven and nine years. The study suggests that children understand the various responses that parents make to purchase requests, for example, agreement, refusal, procrastination, and negotiation, and their parents' rationale for such responses. Furthermore, the outcome of such interaction tends to constitute more of a good-natured `game' between parent and child, as suggested by the children, as opposed to the negative overtones of conflict indicated in the literature.

  abstract = {Complex environmental problems are typically resolved after the public is no longer willing to accept their risks and demands change (i.e., Reflexive Modernization). Notable examples include responses to the ozone hole and acid deposition. In the case of climate change, however, the politicization of the issue can result in adults ignoring the risks and accepting the status quo (i.e., Anti-Reflexivity). Although strategies such as strategic framing have seen some successes, new methods are needed to engage citizens in addressing climate change impacts. We argue that child-based climate communication is an understudied but promising pathway to incite climate action among children and adults alike. Children have unique perspectives on climate change, represent an audience that is easily reached through schools, and are arguably best equipped to navigate the ideologically fraught topic of climate change with older generations in ways that inspire action. We review research to support this novel communication approach and outline best practices for programmatic implementation and associated research.},

It finds that most of the items in the scale are invariant over time but not invariant across countries. Another finding is that using multiplegroup concurrent calibration with partial invariance will make the home possessions scale more comparable over time and across countries, compared to the original home possessions scales that had been generated in each cycle. Moreover, using the new method based on the two-parameter logistic (2PL) model and the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) maintained, and in some cases, even improved the within-country accuracy of the scores, as indicated by an increased regression coefficient when the home possessions scores were used to predict the cognitive proficiency scores for reading, math, and science.},

In this review, we synthesize literature relating to 8- to 19-year-old's perceptions and understandings of climate change, in order to identify trends and inconsistencies, potential gaps in knowledge, and directions for future research. A comprehensive search strategy identified 51 international studies, using quantitative (n = 36), qualitative (n = 9), and mixed methods (n = 6). The included studies date from 1993 to 2018. The analysis outlines levels of reported belief and concern about climate change and perceptions of its causes and consequences. It also details reported perceptions of viable solutions to climate change and notions of responsibility for implementing these. Scientifically accurate knowledge generally increased with age, although misconceptions persisted across the age range. In some studies, younger children expressed greater concern and were more willing to take action than older adolescents. Levels of belief, concern, and willingness to take action were lower in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia than in other countries. In conclusion, we discuss potential explanations for these age and place-related differences, examining the age-related findings in the context of concepts and theories in developmental psychology. We outline the limitations of our review and the reviewed studies, and note potential avenues for future research and implications for educational policy and practice.

It finds that most of the items in the scale are invariant over time but not invariant across countries. Another finding is that using multiplegroup concurrent calibration with partial invariance will make the home possessions scale more comparable over time and across countries, compared to the original home possessions scales that had been generated in each cycle. Moreover, using the new method based on the two-parameter logistic (2PL) model and the generalized partial credit model (GPCM) maintained, and in some cases, even improved the within-country accuracy of the scores, as indicated by an increased regression coefficient when the home possessions scores were used to predict the cognitive proficiency scores for reading, math, and science.},

  abstract = {Despite the scale of the predicted impact of climate change on future generations, most of the academic literature investigating perceptions of climate change relates to adults or young adults rather than children and adolescents. In this review, we synthesize literature relating to 8- to 19-year-old's perceptions and understandings of climate change, in order to identify trends and inconsistencies, potential gaps in knowledge, and directions for future research. A comprehensive search strategy identified 51 international studies, using quantitative (n = 36), qualitative (n = 9), and mixed methods (n = 6). The included studies date from 1993 to 2018. The analysis outlines levels of reported belief and concern about climate change and perceptions of its causes and consequences. It also details reported perceptions of viable solutions to climate change and notions of responsibility for implementing these. Scientifically accurate knowledge generally increased with age, although misconceptions persisted across the age range. In some studies, younger children expressed greater concern and were more willing to take action than older adolescents. Levels of belief, concern, and willingness to take action were lower in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia than in other countries. In conclusion, we discuss potential explanations for these age and place-related differences, examining the age-related findings in the context of concepts and theories in developmental psychology. We outline the limitations of our review and the reviewed studies, and note potential avenues for future research and implications for educational policy and practice.

  abstract = {The left-right self-placement scale is often used in political science as a proxy for the policy positions of voters and parties. Yet studies have suggested that, for voters, this relation is dependent on education level. These studies were, however, hampered by data limitations and restricted statistical analyses. In addition, the extent to which the relation between the left-right self-placement scale and policy positions differs for parties and voters has not been explored. This article looks at the differential relation between left-right self-placement and policy positions for voters with different education levels on an integrated dataset containing over 50 voter and party policy positions. It is found that the left-right self-placement scale is a much better predictor for the policy positions of parties than it is for the policy preferences of voters. Robustness checks show that neither the saliency of the policy positions nor their complexity moderates these findings.},

The lack of availability of diagnostic procedures for hierarchical linear models has limited their adoption in statistical practice. The R package HLMdiag provides diagnostic tools targeting all aspects and levels of continuous response hierarchical linear models with strictly nested dependence structures fit using the lmer() function in the lme4 package. In this paper we discuss the tools implemented in HLMdiag for both residual and influence analysis.},

  abstract = {"Recycle. Fly less. Eat less meat. These are some of the tactics that we've been told can slow climate change. But most of these recommendations are a result of a multi-pronged marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals. Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think "guns don't kill people, people kill people") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's "Crying Indian" commercials of the 1980s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet. In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters–fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: a common-sense, attainable approach to carbon tax– an overhaul of the flawed Green New Deal; allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuels debunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutions how to combat climate doomism With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward. This book will reach, inform, and enable citizens everywhere to join this battle for our planet"–},

  abstract = {"Recycle. Fly less. Eat less meat. These are some of the tactics that we've been told can slow climate change. But most of these recommendations are a result of a multi-pronged marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals. Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think "guns don't kill people, people kill people") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's "Crying Indian" commercials of the 1980s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet. In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters--fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: a common-sense, attainable approach to carbon tax-- an overhaul of the flawed Green New Deal; allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuels debunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutions how to combat climate doomism With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward. This book will reach, inform, and enable citizens everywhere to join this battle for our planet"--},

  abstract = {Background: Climate change has significant implications for the health and futures of children and young people, yet they have little power to limit its harm, making them vulnerable to increased climate anxiety. Qualitative studies show climate anxiety is associated with perceptions of inadequate action by adults and governments, feelings of betrayal, abandonment and moral injury. This study offers the first large-scale investigation of climate anxiety in children and young people globally and its relationship to government response.~Methods: We surveyed 10,000 young people (aged 16-25 years) in ten countries. Data were collected on their thoughts and feelings about climate change, and government response.~~Findings: Respondents were worried about climate change (59\% very~or extremely worried, 84\% at least moderately worried). Over 50\% felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. Over 45\% said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning, and many reported a high number of negative thoughts about climate change. Respondents rated the governmental response to climate change negatively and reported greater feelings of betrayal than of reassurance. Correlations indicated that climate anxiety and distress were significantly related to perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal.~~Interpretation: Climate change and inadequate governmental responses are associated with climate anxiety and distress in many children and young people globally. These psychological stressors threaten health and wellbeing, and could be construed as morally injurious and unjust. There is an urgent need for increases in both research and government responsiveness.~Funding: The costs of the survey were funded by AVAAZ.Declaration of Interest: None to declare. Ethical Approval: The study was approved by the University of Bath Psychology Ethics Committee (\#21-090).},

We demonstrate the importance of adequately modeling the shape of the level-1 growth trajectory in order to make inferences about the importance of both level-1 and level-2 predictors.},

During this same period, the growth rate of CO2 emissions has declined in many developed nations, cumulating to a recent period of decoupling between economic growth and CO2 emissions. The aim of the present study is to advance research on socioeconomic drivers of CO2 emissions by assessing how the distribution of income affects the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. The authors find that from 1985 to 2011, rising income inequality leads to a tighter coupling between economic growth and CO2 emissions in developed nations. Additionally, the authors find that increases in the top 20 percent of income earners? share of national income have resulted in a larger association between economic growth and CO2 emissions, while increases in the bottom 20 percent of income earners? share of national income reduced the association between economic growth and CO2 emissions.},

Overshoot of the earth's natural resource bases militates against our current and future prospects for sustainability. Despite the theoretical and practical impetus to examine these dynamics, there is a dearth of empirical sociological research that analyzes overshoot. The paper fills this gap by offering a structural equation model of each nation's relative contributions to overshoot. The model tests key theorizations in the environmental sociology, development, and global political-economy literatures, and adds to them by theorizing and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women affects and is affected by environmental conditions. Findings support ecofeminist interpretations that resource degradation yields adverse impacts on women and that their representation in government bodes well for the environment.

Effective communication is critical to informing public decision making and behavior to mitigate climate change. An effective method of audience segmentation, the risk perception attitude (RPA) framework, has been previously tested with other health behaviors and classifies people into 4 groups on the basis of their perceptions of risk and beliefs about personal efficacy. The 4 groups—indifference (low risk, weak efficacy), proactive (low risk, strong efficacy), avoidance (high risk, weak efficacy), and responsive (high risk, strong efficacy)—are hypothesized to differ in their self-protective behaviors and in their motivations to seek information. In this article, we extend the RPA framework in two ways. First, we use it at the household level to determine whether parental classifications into the 4 groups are associated with their teenage children's classification into the same 4 groups. Second, we predict adolescent information seeking behaviors on the basis of their and their parents' membership in the 4 RPA groups. Results (N = 523 parent–adolescent pairs) indicated that parental membership in the 4 RPA groups was significantly associated with children's membership in the same 4 groups. Furthermore, the RPA framework was a significant predictor of adolescent information seeking: Those in the responsive and avoidance groups sought more information on climate change than the indifference group. Family communication on global warming was positively associated with adolescents' information seeking. Implications for interventions are discussed.}

Taking advantage of the well-known relationship between the Wald and log likelihood ratio test statistics, we propose a complete-data log likelihood ratio based procedure. It is shown that, for any number of multiple imputations, the proposed procedure is equivalent in large samples to the existing procedure based on the point estimates and the variance-covariance matrices, yet it only requires the point estimates and evaluations of the complete-data log likelihood ratio statistic as a function of these estimates and the completed data. The proposed procedure, therefore, is especially attractive with highly multiparameter incomplete-data problems since it does not involve the computation of any matrices.},

The authors also consider whether economic growth does in fact reduce poverty, exploring the paradox of successful economies that show little evidence of decreasing poverty.Many official figures on urban poverty, including those based on the US \$1 per day poverty line, present a very misleading picture of urban poverty's scale. These common errors in definition and measurement by governments and international agencies lead to poor understanding of urban poverty and inadequate policy provision. This is compounded by the lack of voice and influence that low income groups have in these official spheres.

An academic database, EBSCOhost, was used to identify 959 unique citation records addressing climate change education. Of these, 49 sources met the criteria of focusing on assessment of climate change education interventions. Analysis of these sources examined the intervention purpose, assessment methodology, and identified strategies that might result in effective interventions. Two themes were identified that are common to most environmental education: (1) focusing on personally relevant and meaningful information and (2) using active and engaging teaching methods. Four themes specific to issues such as climate change were also generated: (1) engaging in deliberative discussions, (2) interacting with scientists, (3) addressing misconceptions, and (4) implementing school or community projects. Suggestions for addressing controversial topics like climate change are offered.},

  abstract = {Increased interest in climate change education and the growing recognition of the challenges inherent to addressing this issue create an opportunity to conduct a systematic review to understand what research can contribute to our ideas about effective climate change education. An academic database, EBSCOhost, was used to identify 959 unique citation records addressing climate change education. Of these, 49 sources met the criteria of focusing on assessment of climate change education interventions. Analysis of these sources examined the intervention purpose, assessment methodology, and identified strategies that might result in effective interventions. Two themes were identified that are common to most environmental education: (1) focusing on personally relevant and meaningful information and (2) using active and engaging teaching methods. Four themes specific to issues such as climate change were also generated: (1) engaging in deliberative discussions, (2) interacting with scientists, (3) addressing misconceptions, and (4) implementing school or community projects. Suggestions for addressing controversial topics like climate change are offered.},

But we can fix it.After speaking to the international public for close to fifteen years about sustainability, climate scientist Dr. Nicholas realized that concerned people were getting the wrong message about the climate crisis. Yes, companies and governments are hugely responsible for the mess we're in. But individuals CAN effect real, significant, and lasting change to solve this problem. Nicholas explores finding purpose in a warming world, combining her scientific expertise and her lived, personal experience in a way that seems fresh and deeply urgent: Agonizing over the climate costs of visiting loved ones overseas, how to find low-carbon love on Tinder, and even exploring her complicated family legacy involving supermarket turkeys.In her astonishing book Under the Sky We Make , Nicholas does for climate science what Michael Pollan did more than a decade ago for the food on our plate: offering a hopeful, clear-eyed, and somehow also hilarious guide to effecting real change, starting in our own lives. Saving ourselves from climate apocalypse will require radical shifts within each of us, to effect real change in our society and culture. But it can be done. It requires, Dr. Nicholas argues, belief in our own agency and value, alongside a deep understanding that no one will ever hand us power--we're going to have to seize it for ourselves.},

The accelerating risks entail that private adaptation complement more traditional public climate change adaptation measures. Culture plays an important role in framing how individuals experience hazards and behave toward them. Yet, empirical research explicitly measuring whether and how climate change adaptation varies across cultures is lacking. To address this gap, we collect meta-analytic data on factors motivating individual flooding adaptation from 25 countries and more than 50 publications. Employing Hofstede's Cultural Rankings as a metric of national culture, we model the effect of culture on adaptation motivation of individual households using meta-regression analysis. We find a number of statistically significant relationships between culture and factors motivating private climate change adaptation. Hence, cultural context is vital to consider when designing and implementing climate change adaptation policies, simulating the uptake of individual hazard prevention measures, or integrating private adaptation in assessing costs of climate change in integrated assessment models. These findings are among the first to provide empirical evidence on the interaction effects between culture and private climate change adaptation motivation.},

The data are a national sample of 1225 mail surveys that include measures of risk perceptions and knowledge tied to climate change, support for voluntary and government actions to address the problem, general environmental beliefs, and demographic variables. Risk perceptions matter in predicting behavioral intentions. Risk perceptions are not a surrogate for general environmental beliefs, but have their own power to account for behavioral intentions. There are four secondary conclusions. First, behavioral intentions regarding climate change are complex and intriguing. People are neither “nonbelievers” who will take no initiatives themselves and oppose all government efforts, nor are they “believers” who promise both to make personal efforts and to vote for every government proposal that promises to address climate change. Second, there are separate demographic sources for voluntary actions compared with voting intentions. Third, recognizing the causes of global warming is a powerful predictor of behavioral intentions independent from believing that climate change will happen and have bad consequences. Finally, the success of the risk perception variables to account for behavioral intentions should encourage greater attention to risk perceptions as independent variables. Risk perceptions and knowledge, however, share the stage with general environmental beliefs and demographic characteristics. Although related, risk perceptions, knowledge, and general environmental beliefs are somewhat independent predictors of behavioral intentions.},

  abstract = {The research reported here examines the relationship between risk perceptions and willingness to address climate change. The data are a national sample of 1225 mail surveys that include measures of risk perceptions and knowledge tied to climate change, support for voluntary and government actions to address the problem, general environmental beliefs, and demographic variables. Risk perceptions matter in predicting behavioral intentions. Risk perceptions are not a surrogate for general environmental beliefs, but have their own power to account for behavioral intentions. There are four secondary conclusions. First, behavioral intentions regarding climate change are complex and intriguing. People are neither “nonbelievers” who will take no initiatives themselves and oppose all government efforts, nor are they “believers” who promise both to make personal efforts and to vote for every government proposal that promises to address climate change. Second, there are separate demographic sources for voluntary actions compared with voting intentions. Third, recognizing the causes of global warming is a powerful predictor of behavioral intentions independent from believing that climate change will happen and have bad consequences. Finally, the success of the risk perception variables to account for behavioral intentions should encourage greater attention to risk perceptions as independent variables. Risk perceptions and knowledge, however, share the stage with general environmental beliefs and demographic characteristics. Although related, risk perceptions, knowledge, and general environmental beliefs are somewhat independent predictors of behavioral intentions.},

Factors important for explaining skepticism among adults (values, knowledge, conservative political orientation, gender, media use), a cluster of variables related to societal powerlessness (distrust, disinterest in societal issues, low environmental efficacy, low tolerance toward immigrants), and descriptive social norms (social influence from parents and peers) were included in the study. With the exception of media use in cross-sectional analyses, and of media use and a conservative political orientation in bivariate longitudinal analyses, all of these factors were significantly associated with skepticism.

In this chapter climate change is seen as an existential, moral, and political problem. The aim is to investigate what emotions young people experience, how they cope, and how coping strategies are related to environmental efficacy, environmental engagement, and subjective wellbeing. Worry seems to be the most common emotion. Young people actively cope by using: (1) Problem-focused coping, i.e., thinking about, planning, and trying to do something to fight climate change; (2) Emotion-focused coping, for instance getting rid of negative emotions with distancing strategies; (3) Meaning-focused coping and hope, i.e., being able to switch perspective and see both negative and positive trends, and putting trust in more powerful societal actors. Meaning-focused coping seems to be an especially constructive strategy, since it is positively associated with environmental efficacy and engagement, as well as wellbeing. The chapter ends by arguing that it is important to let young people give voice to their climate-related emotions and that it is vital to realize that coping not only takes place at an individual level but is also a social process in which the adult world plays an important role.},

  abstract = {The growth in global climate protests by students challenge the status quo of policy makers and political leaders in mitigating the effects of climate change. These events suggest that young people are increasingly well-informed and aware of environmental issues and the impact of increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To investigate how well-informed students are on the issue of climate change, we have used secondary data from the Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA) [1], a cross-national study involving 540,000 students in 72 OECD and partner countries to explore students’ responses. Our analysis of these data provides unparalleled insight into fifteen-year-old students’ self-reported awareness about greenhouse gases and how this varies by achievement, enjoyment of and interest in science, students’ socio-economic status and country of origin. We find there are substantial global variations in students’ awareness of greenhouse gases, which is independent of the international ranking of PISA scores. Measures of scientific literacy have the greatest association with students’ awareness about greenhouse gases, although enjoyment of science and interest in broad scientific topics suggests that school science courses that are rigorous in content and enjoyable for students prepare them to be wellinformed citizens about climate change. Given the global interest in issues of equity, we argue that both schools and curriculum designers have the ability to cultivate enjoyment and interest to build positive attitudes, awareness and responsibility towards the environment alongside the development of scientific literacy.},

The analyses are conducted with the general diagnostic model (GDM), which is a modeling framework that contains all IRT models used in the paper as special cases. The paper also investigated whether the use of an alternative score scale (i.e., a scale that includes the use of international and a subset of country-specific parameters) as compared to the use of solely international parameters for country score scale calibrations led to improvement of fit. Analyses were conducted using discrete mixture distribution IRT as well as multiple group (M-)IRT models.

  abstract = {Unusually warm or cool weather has a short-term influence on public opinion of "global warming." This paper extends this idea by showing that both regional climate (average long-term temperature) and seasonal variation in average temperature predict variation in public skepticism about global warming. Analyses of both polling data and Google search volume data show that in regions with colder climates (both U.S. states and nations), there is more public skepticism about global warming. The effects of climate remained even after controlling for regional confounds such as age, education, income, cultural values, and political attitudes. Follow-up analyses suggested that cold temperatures play a stronger role than hot temperatures in shaping public skepticism about global warming. A third study set focusing on four English-speaking nations suggested that seasonal variation in temperature is also predictably related to public skepticism about global warming. Public opinion about the reality of this specific aspect of climate change appears to be susceptible to egocentric biases such as memorial availability and construct accessibility. All else being equal, climate change educators will likely face more pushback about global warming in places with cold climates and at times of the year when the weather is cold.},

The seven steps are illustrated with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal MLM example from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) dataset.

That is, does b,  = b,? Traditionally, criminologists have employed a t or z test for the difference between slopes in making these coeficient comparisons. While there is considerable consensus as to the appropriateness of this strategy, there has been some confusion in the criminological literature as to the correct estimator of the standard error of the difference, the standard deviation of the sampling distribu-tion of coeficient differences, in the t or z formula.

One particular area of concern is that many science teachers in the USA encourage students to debate settled empirical findings, such as the role of human-generated emissions of greenhouse gases in raising global temperatures. A common reaction is to call for science teachers to receive more formal training in climate science to increase their knowledge, which will then improve teaching. Using a nationally representative survey of 1500 middle school and high school science teachers, we investigate each element in this argument, and show that increased science coursework in college has modest effects on teachers' content knowledge and on their teaching choices, including decisions about debating “both sides.” We also find that teachers' personal political orientations play a large role in their teaching strategies: right-leaning teachers devote somewhat less time to global warming and are much more likely to encourage student debate on the causes of global warming. We discuss the implications of these findings and argue teacher education might be more effective if informed by insights from the emerging discipline of science communication. However, although knowledge and ideology are predictive of pedagogy, a large number of teachers of all ideological positions and all levels of subject expertise encourage students to debate established findings. We discuss this and highlight potential explanations.},

Only then will contemporary calls by organisations such as UNEP and UNESCO that ‘environmental education be a core component of all education systems at all levels by 2025’, have a chance of gaining the multilateral and multileveled support the situation so urgently requires.},

To accomplish this task, a set of common items is repeatedly administered in each assessment and linking methods are used to align the results from the different assessments on a common scale. The present article introduces a framework for discussing linking errors in ILSAs, in which different components of linking errors are distinguished (countryby-item interaction, assessment-by-item interaction and countryby-assessment-by-item interaction). Furthermore, the different components of linking errors are used to analytically derive standard errors for national trend estimates. In a simulation study, the proposed standard error formula outperforms the method that is used in PISA. In addition, the PISA 2006 and 2009 reading data are used to illustrate how the interpretation of national trend estimates can change when different procedures are applied to calculate standard errors.},

Applying a systematic literature review process, we analysed existing literature from 1993 to 2014 regarding climate change education for children and young people, with the aim of identifying key areas for further research. While a number of studies have indicated that young people's understandings of climate change are generally limited, erroneous and highly influenced by mass media, other studies suggest that didactic approaches to climate change education have been largely ineffectual in affecting students' attitudes and behaviour. The review identifies the need for participatory, interdisciplinary, creative, and affect-driven approaches to climate change education, which to date have been largely missing from the literature. In conclusion, we call for the development of new forms of climate change education that directly involve young people in responding to the scientific, social, ethical, and political complexities of climate change.},

  abstract = {In the current article, we consider the influential position of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and discuss several methodological areas that demonstrate the need for caution when using and interpreting PISA results. We motivate our argument by briefly describing the program?s increased influence in educational policy over time. Subsequently, we describe the methodological areas of interest, including sampling participants, the achievement estimation model, and measuring trends. We also offer our perspectives on how the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development might productively and more clearly communicate PISA?s limitations.},

Using cross-sectional data from a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,303), we investigate the “Greta Thunberg Effect,” or whether exposure to Greta Thunberg predicts collective efficacy and intentions to engage in collective action. We find that those who are more familiar with Greta Thunberg have higher intentions of taking collective actions to reduce global warming and that stronger collective efficacy beliefs mediate this relationship. This association between familiarity with Greta Thunberg, collective efficacy beliefs, and collective action intentions is present even after accounting for respondents' overall support for climate activism. Moderated mediation models testing age and political ideology as moderators of the “Greta Thunberg Effect” indicate that although the indirect effect of familiarity with Greta Thunberg via collective efficacy is present across all age-groups, and across the political spectrum, it may be stronger among those who identify as more liberal (than conservative). Our findings suggest that young public figures like Greta Thunberg may motivate collective action across the U.S. public, but their effect may be stronger among those with a shared political ideology.

However, cross-national differential item functioning (DIF) has been repeatedly documented. We ran a simulation study using national item parameters, which required trends to be computed separately for each country, to compare trend estimation performances to two linking methods employing international item parameters across several conditions. The trend estimates based on the national item parameters were more accurate than the trend estimates based on the international item parameters when cross-national DIF was present. Moreover, the use of fixed common item parameter calibrations led to biased trend estimates. The detection and elimination of DIF can reduce this bias but is also likely to increase the total error.},

  abstract = {Conventional model selection evaluates models on their ability to represent data accurately, ignoring their dependence on theoretical and methodological assumptions. Drawing on the concept of underdetermination from the philosophy of science, the author argues that uncritical use of methodological assumptions can pose a problem for effective inference. By ignoring the plausibility of assumptions, existing techniques select models that are poor representations of theory and are thus suboptimal for inference. To address this problem, the author proposes a new paradigm for inference-oriented model selection that evaluates models on the basis of a trade-off between model fit and model plausibility. By comparing the fits of sequentially nested models, it is possible to derive an empirical lower bound for the subjective plausibility of assumptions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the method is applied to models of the relationship between cultural tastes and network composition.},

  abstract = {Economic and demographic transitions led by the persistent increase in the per capita income have challenged the environmental conservation drive in most of the developing nations. Therefore, in recent years, policymakers emphasized the need for navigating the harmful impacts of economic growth endeavors on the established ecosystem. In this regard, the widespread usage of renewable energy solutions has helped in restoring the environmental quality in both developed and developing countries. Keeping this in mind, in the present study, we examined the long run and short-run impacts of per capita income, renewable energy, life expectancy, and population density on the ecological footprint in the eight developing countries of South and Southeast Asia from 1990 to 2015. In the selected nations, these variables appear to be the potential drivers of the ecological footprint. To calculate the common coefficients, we have employed the cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach, as this approach handles the cross-sectional dependency issue efficiently and provides the short-run and long-run coefficients. The long-run results supported the need for low pollution-intense energy resources because the association between per capita income and ecological footprint is found N-shaped. Further, the study established that the increased use of renewable energy has significantly reduced the ecological footprint in the region. However, the increased population density has led to an increase in pollution emissions in these countries. Similarly, the impact of life expectancy on the ecological footprint is found positive but insignificant. Based on the findings, a multipronged policy framework has been designed, so that these nations can attain the objectives of certain sustainable development goals (SDGs).},

It argues that while the statistical and methodological aspects of PISA have received much research attention, other elements of PISA have been largely ignored. In particular, there are several outcomes of PISA testing that point towards a significant research agenda.

  abstract = {To achieve the targets of climate change policy, it is important not only to enhance concerns about climate change but also to promote climate-friendly behaviour. Encompassing European Union (EU) countries, the objective of this paper was to analyse how economic development and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions contributed to climate change concerns, personal responsibility, and actions related to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, considering that actions related to climate change mitigation have different costs and benefits, in this study, we aimed to reveal whether climate change concerns and personal responsibility equally influenced all actions related to climate change mitigation and whether all types of actions were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of actions related to climate change mitigation varied across European countries. The largest share of respondents declared that they reduce waste and regularly separate it for recycling. Meanwhile, a smaller share of people noted that they perform very high-cost actions such as the purchase of low-energy homes and electric cars. Economic development level significantly affects the assumption of personal responsibility and the number of actions related to climate change mitigation but not climate change concerns. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions influence climate change concerns, responsibility, and the number of actions differently. Considering separate actions related to climate change mitigation, the assumption of personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced almost all actions. Climate change concerns positively and significantly affected only low-cost actions. Because of the different costs and guiding goals, the respondents who performed one action did not necessarily perform other actions related to climate change mitigation.},

This study explores the issue of linking error in estimating trends, or changes in achievement over time. As part of documenting the changes in student achievement from each assessment cycle to the next, the results are reported together with their standard errors. Typically, the standard errors incorporate a component due to sampling variance and a smaller component resulting from the use of plausible values and conditioning (imputation variance). Recently, there has been research investigating the error component due to linking consecutive assessments, which results from updating the item pool from assessment to assessment. This study examines the error components in linking the 2001 and 2006 PIRLS assessments, focusing on the error component due to changes in the item parameters from one assessment to the next. As anticipated, this error component was small, most likely because almost half the items were in common between the two PIRLS assessments.},

In a textbook example, if all I know is thatyou spent \$10 on apples and oranges and that apples cost \$1 whileoranges cost \$2, then I know that you did not buy six oranges, but Ido not know whether you bought one orange and eight apples, twooranges and six apples, and so on. A simple scientific example can befound in the rationale behind the sensible methodological adage that“correlation does not imply causation”. If watching lotsof cartoons causes children to be more violent in their playgroundbehavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find acorrelation between levels of cartoon viewing and violent playgroundbehavior. But that is also what we would expect to find ifchildren who are prone to violence tend to enjoy and seek out cartoonsmore than other children, or if propensities to violence and increasedcartoon viewing are both caused by some third factor (like generalparental neglect or excessive consumption of Twinkies). So a highcorrelation between cartoon viewing and violent playground behavior isevidence that (by itself) simply underdetermines what weshould believe about the causal relationship between the two. But itturns out that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches thesurface of the various ways in which problems of underdeterminationcan arise in the course of scientific investigation.},

Three types of support (citizenship actions, policy support and acceptance, and personal-sphere behaviors that accord with movement principles) are empirically distinct from each other and from committed activism. Drawing on theoretical work on values and norm-activation processes, we propose a value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of movement support. Individuals who accept a movement's basic values, believe that valued objects are threatened, and believe that their actions can help restore those values experience an obligation (personal norm) for pro-movement action that creates a predisposition to provide support; the particular type of support that results is dependent on the individual's capabilities and constraints. Data from a national survey of 420 respondents suggest that the VBN theory, when compared with other prevalent theories, offers the best available account of support for the environmental movement.}

The EKC proposes that indicators of environmental degradation first rise, and then fall with increasing income per capita. Recent evidence shows however, that developing countries are addressing environmental issues, sometimes adopting developed country standards with a short time lag and sometimes performing better than some wealthy countries, and that the EKC results have a very flimsy statistical foundation. A new generation of decomposition and efficient frontier models can help disentangle the true relations between development and the environment and may lead to the demise of the classic EKC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critical history of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The EKC proposes that indicators of environmental degradation first rise, and then fall with increasing income per capita. Recent evidence shows however, that developing countries are addressing environmental issues, sometimes adopting developed country standards with a short time lag and sometimes performing better than some wealthy countries, and that the EKC results have a very flimsy statistical foundation. A new generation of decomposition and efficient frontier models can help disentangle the true relations between development and the environment and may lead to the demise of the classic EKC.},

  abstract = {Though many climate literacy efforts attempt to communicate climate change as a risk, these strategies may be ineffective because among adults, worldview rather than scientific understanding largely drives climate change risk perceptions. Further, increased science literacy may polarize worldview-driven perceptions, making some climate literacy efforts ineffective among skeptics. Because worldviews are still forming in the teenage years, adolescents may represent a more receptive audience. This study examined how worldview and climate change knowledge related to acceptance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and in turn, climate change risk perception among middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n\,=\,387). We found respondents with individualistic worldviews were 16.1 percentage points less likely to accept AGW than communitarian respondents at median knowledge levels, mirroring findings in similar studies among adults. The interaction between knowledge and worldview, however, was opposite from previous studies among adults, because increased climate change knowledge was positively related to acceptance of AGW among both groups, and had a stronger positive relationship among individualists. Though individualists were 24.1 percentage points less likely to accept AGW than communitarians at low levels (bottom decile) of climate change knowledge, there was no statistical difference in acceptance levels between individualists and communitarians at high levels of knowledge (top decile). Non-White and females also demonstrated higher levels of AGW acceptance and climate change risk perception, respectively. Thus, education efforts specific to climate change may counteract divisions based on worldviews among adolescents.},

Relevant literature is briefly reviewed on student and teacher understandings of climate change and conceptions of climate change education as education for preparing students for future climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and the potential for disaster. Opportunities in Australian schools for teaching climate change mitigation and adaptation are critically examined. Climate change should be understood as a complex social as well as scientific issue characterized by uncertain and context-specific knowledge. This demands educators engage in inquiry and co-learning with students. The lack of time and the reported curriculum opportunities to address climate change in the classroom suggest a need for using co-curricular and community initiatives for student investigations and learning. Teachers must encourage students to think critically and creatively about approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation and develop their capacity to respond with meaningful actions.},

However, few of these studies have employed treatment/control designs that might address causality and none have addressed how these factors might interact to influence behavior. We developed a model of behavior change where a climate education treatment impacted knowledge, knowledge impacted hope and concern, and hope and concern together impacted behavior. We empirically tested the utility of this model and the causal relationships within it using a pre/post, treatment/control evaluation of climate education among adolescents in North Carolina, USA (n = 1041). We found support for a causal relationship between the treatment and gains in knowledge, but not between treatment and behavior. However, we did find support for a path model in which climate change knowledge positively relates to increased climate change concern and hope, and increases in concern and hope predict changes in pro-environmental behavior. Low SES was related to smaller gains in knowledge, concern, and behavior. Our results contribute to a theoretical understanding of climate change behaviors among adolescents and suggest that climate education aiming to change behavior should focus on building hope and concern.},

Prior research shows that climate education may build concern among adolescents, but other factors such as peer pressure may also be important. We investigated the relationships between CCC, acceptance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), perceived level of acceptance among friends and family, and frequency of discussion of the issue among 426 middle school students in North Carolina, USA, and developed a novel instrument to measure each of these constructs. Acceptance of AGW had the strongest association with CCC. Frequency of discussion with friends and family was the second strongest predictor. Perceived level of acceptance among family and friends was the third strongest predictor. Model selection results suggest family had more influence than friends in this study. Girls perceived climate change as a higher risk than boys. In addition to building acceptance of AGW, leveraging discussions with peers and especially family may help build concern for climate change among future generations.}

In those studies, stratified sampling method is employed in order to draw participants, and hence, the data gathered has a hierarchical structure. In the context of large-scale assessments, plausible values refer to randomly drawn values from posterior ability distribution. It is reported that using one of plausible values or mean of those values as independent variable in linear models may lead to some estimation errors. Moreover, it is observed that sampling weights sometimes are not used during analysis of large-scale assessment data. This study aims to investigate the influence of three approaches on the parameters of linear and hierarchical linear regression models: 1) using only one plausible value, 2) using all plausible values, 3) incorporating sampling weights or not. Data used in the present study is obtained from school and student questionnaires in PISA (2015) Turkey database. Results revealed that the use of sampling weights and number of plausible values has significant effects on regression coefficients, standard errors and explained variance for both regression models. Findings of the study were discussed in details and some conclusions were drawn for practice and further research.},

Parental education has an important influence upon the development of environmental attitudes among young people, with the children of tertiary-educated parents much more likely than others to be concerned about planetary warming. A strong gender divide is also apparent, with young women consistently more concerned about ?the environment? than young men are. Political party identification has an important influence upon environmental concerns even among these 16?17-year olds, with young conservative party identifiers far less likely than Greens or Labor identifiers to believe that global warming will pose a serious risk in their lifetime, after controlling for beliefs in human-induced climate change. The party identification findings point to an emerging support base of young Australians for parties that adopt a progressive stance on climate change.}

  abstract = {A large survey of young people in Queensland, Australia, indicates that the majority believe that climate change is occurring, that the planet is warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, and that anthropogenic global warming poses a serious risk to Australia. Parental education has an important influence upon the development of environmental attitudes among young people, with the children of tertiary-educated parents much more likely than others to be concerned about planetary warming. A strong gender divide is also apparent, with young women consistently more concerned about ?the environment? than young men are. Political party identification has an important influence upon environmental concerns even among these 16?17-year olds, with young conservative party identifiers far less likely than Greens or Labor identifiers to believe that global warming will pose a serious risk in their lifetime, after controlling for beliefs in human-induced climate change. The party identification findings point to an emerging support base of young Australians for parties that adopt a progressive stance on climate change.},

  abstract = {Engaging adolescents is critical to encouraging future climate change adaptation and mitigation behaviours. Adolescents are typically more receptive to climate change messages than adults, but educators and communicators need research-based strategies for optimizing engagement, including information about what factors are most influential in changing behaviours. To better understand how communication with teachers, friends and family, climate change knowledge and climate change concern predict climate change behaviour, we administered a survey to a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1371). We measured climate change behaviour with a multi-item scale asking respondents about energy conservation, alternative transportation and engagement with environmental issues. We found that climate change concern and discussing climate change with family and friends predicted climate change behaviour. We also found that students from urban, high socioeconomic status schools were more likely to engage in climate change behaviour than students in urban, low socioeconomic status schools or rural schools. These results suggest that education efforts should leverage communication with family and friends in programming designed to encourage climate change behaviour. Further, efforts to promote climate change behaviour among low socioeconomic status urban and rural adolescents may be warranted, but would benefit from further investigation into the ideological, physical and knowledge-based drivers of behaviour differences documented in this study.},

  abstract = {A geographical education offers more than skills, subject knowledge and generic attributes. It also develops a set of discipline-specific capabilities that contribute to a graduate's future learning and experience, granting them special ways of thinking for lifelong development and for contributing to the welfare of themselves, their community and their world. This paper considers the broader purposes and values of disciplinary teaching in contributing to individual human development. Set in the context of recent debates concerning the role of the university and the neo-liberalisation of higher education this paper explores approaches to developing the geography curriculum in ways that re-assert the educational value of geographical thinking for students. Using international examples of teaching and learning practice in geography, we recognise five geocapabilities: use of the geographical imagination; ethical subjecthood with respect to the impacts of geographical processes; integrative thinking about society–environment relationships; spatial thinking; and the structured exploration of places. A capabilities approach offers a productive and resilient response to the threats of pedagogic frailty and increasingly generic learning in higher education. Finally, a framework to stimulate dialogue about curriculum development and the role of geocapabilities in the higher education curriculum is suggested.},

  abstract = {Female education and family planning are both critical for sustainable development, and they obviously merit expanded support without any appeal to global climate considerations. However, even relatively optimistic projections suggest that family planning and female education will suffer from financing deficits that will leave millions of women unserved in the coming decades. Since both activities affect fertility, population growth, and carbon emissions, they may also provide sufficient climate-related benefits to warrant additional financing from resources devoted to carbon emissions abatement. This paper considers the economic case for such support. Using recent data on emissions, program effectiveness and program costs, we estimate the cost of carbon emissions abatement via family planning and female education. We compare our estimates with the costs of numerous technical abatement options that have been estimated by Nauclér and Enkvist in a major study for McKinsey and Company (2009). We find that the population policy options are much less costly than almost all of the options Nauclér and Enkvist provide for low-carbon energy development, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, second-generation biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. They are also cost-competitive with forest conservation and other improvements in forestry and agricultural practices. We conclude that female education and family planning should be viewed as viable potential candidates for financial support from global climate funds. The case for female education is also strengthened by its documented contribution to resilience in the face of the climate change that has already become inevitable.},

Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4\% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap.},

  abstract = {Despite an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change poses severe risks to human and natural systems, many young Canadian adults do not view it as a major issue. We analyzed secondary science curricula in each province for their coverage of climate change according to six core topics: physical climate mechanisms (“It's climate”), observed increase in temperature (“It's warming”), anthropogenic causes of warming (“It's us”), scientific consensus (“Experts agree”), negative consequences associated with warming (“It's bad”), and the possibility for avoiding the worst effects (“We can fix it”). We found that learning objectives tend to focus on knowledge of the first three elements, with little or no emphasis on scientific consensus, climate change impacts, or ways to address the issue. The provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario provide the most comprehensive standards for climate change education, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick provide the least. We conducted interviews with individuals responsible for curriculum design in six different provinces to understand how curriculum documents are developed and whether political controversies influence the writing process. Interviewees described a process relying on input from professionals, institutions, and members of the public where curriculum developers made decisions independent of political concerns. In some cases, efforts to provide balance may have led to a focus on social controversy, contrary to overwhelming scientific consensus. Curriculum documents are the basis for teacher instruction and textbook content; aligning these documents with the best possible evidence can improve student learning and engage the next generation of Canadians on the critical issue of climate change.},

The statistical problem is whether the coefficients associated with a given set of covariates change significantly when other covariates are added into the model as controls. Methods for such comparison exist for independent data but do not apply when data are clustered such as longitudinal or familial data. Under the framework of generalized estimating equations, the authors develop statistical methods for such comparison. The properties of the proposed estimator of the difference in regression coefficients between two models are studied asymptotically and for finite samples through simulation. Application of the method to data on changes in depression mood from adolescence through young adulthood reveals that the effect of age after controlling for work status and marital status, although still significant, is largely reduced.},

One key limitation to a precise understanding of anthropogenic impacts is the absence of a set of refined analytic tools. Here we assess the analytic utility of the well-known IPAT identity, the newly developed ImPACT identity, and their stochastic cousin, the STIRPAT model. We discuss the relationship between these three formulations, their similar conceptual underpinnings and their divergent uses. We then refine the STIRPAT model by developing the concept of ecological elasticity (EE). To illustrate the application of STIRPAT and EE, we compute the ecological elasticities of population, affluence and other factors for cross-national emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel combustion and for the energy footprint, a composite measure comprising impacts from fossil fuel combustion, fuel wood, hydropower and nuclear power. Our findings suggest that population has a proportional effect (unitary elasticity) on CO2 emissions and the energy footprint. Affluence monotonically increases both CO2 emissions and the energy footprint. However, for the energy footprint the relationship between affluence and impact changes from inelastic to elastic as affluence increases, while for CO2 emissions the relationship changes from elastic to inelastic. Climate appears to affect both measures of impact, with tropical nations having considerably lower impact than non-tropical nations, controlling for other factors. Finally, indicators of modernization (urbanization and industrialization) are associated with high impacts. We conclude that the STIRPAT model, augmented with measures of ecological elasticity, allows for a more precise specification of the sensitivity of environmental impacts to the forces driving them. Such specifications not only inform the basic science of environmental change, but also point to the factors that may be most responsive to policy.},

We empirically examine the determinants of rice growers' intentions towards mitigation and adaption and their actual behaviors via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results indicate that for TPB, behavioral intentions and perceived behavioral control account for 42.1\% of farmers' adaptation behaviors, but only 25.6\% for mitigation behaviors. In contrast, for the VBN theory, proenvironmental personal norms explain 54.2\% of growers' mitigation behaviors, but only 28.4\% of adaptation behaviors. Thus, TPB appears to be more successful at predicting self-interest-oriented behaviors, such as climate change adaptation. On the other hand, our findings provide evidence that the VBN theory performs better when explaining altruistic behaviors like mitigation behaviors.

Since then, widespread attention has been devoted to determining when and how this goal will be achieved. This study aims to explore the role of China's changing regional development patterns in the achievement of this goal. This study uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to estimate seven socioeconomic drivers of the changes in CO2 emissions in China since 2000. The results show that China's carbon emissions have plateaued since 2012 mainly because of energy efficiency gains and structural upgrades (i.e., industrial structure, energy mix and regional structure). Regional structure, measured by provincial economic growth shares, has drastically reduced CO2 emissions since 2012. The effects of these drivers on emissions changes varied across regions due to their different regional development patterns. Industrial structure and energy mix resulted in emissions growth in some regions, but these two drivers led to emissions reduction at the national level. For example, industrial structure reduced China's CO2 emissions by 1.0\% from 2013 to 2016; however, it increased CO2 emissions in the Northeast and Northwest regions by 1.7\% and 0.9\%, respectively. Studying China's plateauing CO2 emissions in the new normal stage at the regional level yields a strong recommendation that China's regions cooperate to improve development patterns.},

  abstract = {A complex issue at the intersection of science, emotion, and politics, climate change is on the minds of young people across the globe, as evidenced through worldwide climate strikes. This manuscript presents an analysis of letters written by 350 young people across the US during the 2016 Presidential election season. These letters, submitted through a digital platform called “Letters to the Next President,” demanded public attention to climate change. Using mixed-methods, we identified in these letters three distinct discourses, or ways of discussing climate change: a solution-oriented discourse, a climate politics discourse, and a discourse of doom. These discourses give insight into the types of knowledge and emotions that intersect for youth about climate change, while also demonstrating the politicization of climate change for some youth in the US. We offer research and pedagogical implications, noting the need for educators to consider the politicized contexts that shape climate change learning.},
